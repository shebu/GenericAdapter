
Hello ! 
This is my first piece of code in Mono (if you except all the 'hello world' projects...).

My purpose is to make a easy to integrate adapter to work with most of the situation you need one. 
And, besides, i'm a bit lazy (well, in fact no, but i don't like to write the same code more than once). So,
i want a solution when :
- i don't need to override an adapter every time you need on
- i don't have to save datas in the adapter, plus in the database, plus etc.
- i can change my view or/and my data source witout rewriting all the adapter

As i'm a newbie in android and mono droid, i've published my implementation in github to receive comments and advices from 
you, guys.


== First publish : 09/15/11
this is the first publish. Not a perfect solution, i guess, but it works on emulator (emulator ? hum, yes, the full license price is
quite high for a 'just to see' approach). 
The solution includes my GenericAdapter and a example of use. 

Complete description of classes and comments in code will come soon. 



Feel free to comment.
